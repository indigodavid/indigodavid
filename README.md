- 👋 Hi, I’m @indigodavid. I am changing my career to become a Software Developer. I learned basic programming on Java and C a few years ago, but I am catching up with the current technologies. I used to create websites on HTML5 and CSS3 as well.
- 👀 I’m interested in coding Java and eventually learning MacOS coding, Obj-C, Swift, among others.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Java, Javascript, and modern programming skills.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any software as a Junior developer until I get more experience in the field. I also would like to collaborate on ARM-based software since I am interested in the new Apple Processors capabilities (M1, M1 Pro, and M1 MAX).
- 📫 People can reach me by email: indigodavid@gmail.com.
