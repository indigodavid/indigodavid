### 👋 Hi, I'm David Vera Castillo

- 👀 I’m know CSS, HTML, Javascript, Java, and a bit of C. I am learning React, Ruby, Swift, among other technologies.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on different kinds of software projects to hone my problem solving skills. 
- 💻 I also would like to collaborate on ARM-based software since I am interested in the new Apple Processors capabilities (M1, M1 Pro, and M1 MAX).
